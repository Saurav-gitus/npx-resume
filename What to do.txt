Publish Your Resume as an npm Package
Task
Create and publish your resume as a public npm package using your LinkedIn ID as the package name. When someone runs your package via npx, it should display your resume directly in the terminal.

Requirements
The package must be named after your LinkedIn handle. For example, if your profile is linkedin.com/in/xyz, the package name should be @xyz.
Running the following command should print a well-formatted version of your resume: npx @your-linkedin-id

Minimum duration should be 2 minutes, maximum 5 minutes and the ideal length would be around 3-4 minutes. IMPORTANT NOTE: You have to show your face as well. Make sure to speak in English while showing the demo.
